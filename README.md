# COVID19_Policy
An open-source project on collecting and evaluating the projects, data, paper, and models on how government makes decisions to react to COVID-19.

There are growing number of predictive models and analysis for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, their results differ and rely on various assumptions. To make them more useful, the models need to be open-source and the policy makers should inform the public how they use the model to make the decision (such as lockdown).
